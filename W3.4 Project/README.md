This repo is created for Coursera Data Science project
## Input file

The original data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. Its purpose is to utilize machine learning approach to predict the activity of a given subject using the data collected.
Full description of the dataset can be find here <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones>

## Documents
run_analysis.R: This script basically has 5 usages
* Download the raw data and extract files to the workspace
* Merge the training, test sets, subject ID (sample) and activity (prediction) to generate a single dataset for downstreaming analysis
* Extract measturements only related to mean() and std()
* Replace the simplified activity ID with descriptive names for better demostration of the dataset
* Properly name each variable extracted (feature) based on the description given by the author for best demostration of the dataset
* Generate a separate tidy data with mean of each measurements grouping by activity and subject ID

tidy_dataset.txt: This file contains the table generated by run_analysis.R.
